# rust_code
All the following code is the replication of the GAUSS code which is written by Professor John Rust on Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zurcher. All the Python code is written by me.

For privacy reasons, I cannot unfortunately share the completed program.

I coded the GAUSS program in Python to test some statistical assumptions in a neater way.
